## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox

## What I learned

I got more confortable with using Figma (incl. dev mode) and handling the margin and padding. I also improved my general understaning of GitHub workflows, while creating new repository, moving local folders, cloning repository and using the integrated Source Control in VS Code.

## Continued Development

Since it is only my second Frontend Mentor solution, I want to keep improving my workflows, working with Figma, VS Code and GitHub for version control.
